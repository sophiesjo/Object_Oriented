PROJECT TITLE:  Aquarium Lab Series

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  To provide a learning environment in which to
develop hands-on experience with a variety of Java language constructs,
including constructing objects, invoking methods, using if statements
and for loops, stepping through lists of objects, and adding new
instance variables and methods.

This programming project will ask the user for the number of fish and the 
number of steps and will create an aquarium simulation that displays the number
of fish inputted and will move the fish the number of times inputted.

The lab instructions for the Aquarium Lab Series can be found at:

VERSION or DATE:  18 January 2021

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  Within BlueJ, compile the project, if
necessary (see next paragraph).  Then right-click (or control-click)
on the AquaSimApplication.  Select "void main(String[] args)", then
click on "Ok".

AUTHORS: Alyce Brady, Sophie Sjogren

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Input the number of fish and the number of steps that the simulation will have, then
click on the Start button to see the initial configuration of the
aquarium and the fish will move the number of steps that was inputted.

Close the window to end the program.
